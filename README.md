## Requirements
- Android SDK 15+

## Usage

Add to your root build.gradle:
```Groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency:
```Groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.Yalantis:Koloda-Android:v0.0.3-alpha'
}
```

## How to use this library in your project?

First of all, add `Koloda` to the xml layout of your activity, so it looks like that:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<com.yalantis.library.Koloda
	android:id="@+id/koloda"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"
	app:koloda_card_layout="@layout/item_koloda" />
```

Create your adapter and set it to Koloda adapter
```Kotlin
adapter = YourAdapter(data)
koloda.adapter = adapter
```

## Customization

For customization ui Koloda you can use such attributes value :

To control the card position by scale lower cards set koloda_card_scale_diff attributes float value in layout. The range of ScaleDiff is 0.01 - 0.1. The default value for ScaleDiff is 0.04f
```xml
<com.yalantis.library.Koloda
	...	
        app:koloda_card_scale_diff="0.04" 
        ...
/>
```

To control distance between cards set value to koloda_card_offsetY in dp. The default value for CardOffsetY is 16dp.
```xml
 <com.yalantis.library.Koloda
 	...	
        app:koloda_card_offsetY="16dp" 
        ...
/>
```
Change angle for card when swipe it you can set value to koloda_card_rotate_angle. The default value for CardRotateAngle is 30
```xml
<com.yalantis.library.Koloda
	...	
        app:koloda_card_rotate_angle="30"
        ...
/>
```

Also you can change visible cards count in desk with koloda_max_visible_cards attributes. The default value for CardsVisible is 3
```xml
<com.yalantis.library.Koloda
	...	
        app:koloda_max_visible_cards="3"
        ...
/>
```

Koloda has reloadPreviousCard() method which reload previous card
```Kotlin
koloda.reloadPreviousCard()
```

Koloda has reloadAdapterData() method which reload all data(Start show data from the beginning)
```Kotlin
koloda.reloadAdapterData() 
```

Also, you can realize automatic swipe using onButtonClicks(isSwipeCardToRight: Boolean) method:
```Kotlin
koloda.onButtonClick(false) - swipe to left
koloda.onButtonClick(true) - swipe to right
```

Also you can create `KolodaListener` and use all the methods of the `KolodaListener`. This interface provides empty implementations of the methods. For any custom animation callback handle you can create any custom listener that cares only about a subset of the methods of this listener can simply implement the interface directly:
```
onNewTopCard(position: Int)
onCardDrag(position: Int, cardView: View, progress: Float)
onCardSwipedLeft(position: Int)
onCardSwipedRight(position: Int)
onClickRight(position: Int)
onClickLeft(position: Int)
onCardSingleTap(position: Int)
onCardDoubleTap(position: Int)
onCardLongPress(position: Int)
onEmptyDeck()
```

## Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation.
